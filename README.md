# User Sessions

A Meteor lib for tracking users across requests

## TODO

Client stubb for internal methods

Clear stuff add to context by injectSessionToRemoteMethodCalls, but not until after all the middleware has been run (if possible)

Maybe it's possible to use inject/load of session ID on internal methods

Add some acceptance tests to avoid overhead of little changes
