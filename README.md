# Client Sessions for Meteor

A smart package for tracking clients across requests

[Check out the demo!](http://client-sessions.meteor.com/)

## Usage

I'll add instructions eventually. Until then check out demo app in repo.

## TODO

We're stomping on the the context that Meteor gives to Meteor.methods, fix this!

Add an endpoint that can delete expired sessions, find nice way to schedule
